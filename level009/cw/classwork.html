        <h4>The BMW M5 is a high-performance version of the BMW 5 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH, built from 1992 to 1995, 2006 to 2010, and since 2024. The M5 has continuously been produced in the saloon body style, in some countries also as an estate.[1][2][3]
        The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.[4] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</h4>

        <h4>The first BMW M5, based on the E28 5 Series, was manufactured from October 1984 to June 1988.[6] It made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show in February 1985.[7] It was based on the 535i chassis with various mechanical changes, most notably the M88/3 engine (shared with the E24 M635CSi grand tourer coupé) which was an updated version of the engine used in the M1 sports car.[6] At its launch, the E28 M5 was the fastest production saloon in the world.[4]</h4>

    <h3><i><u><strong>Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic vehicles, the film follows a young self-obsessed racecar named Lightning McQueen who, on the way to the most important race of his life, becomes stranded in a forgotten town along U.S. Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he learns about friendship and begins to reevaluate his priorities.</strong></u></i></h3>
